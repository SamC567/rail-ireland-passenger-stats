# Rail Ireland Passenger Statistics (C, Linked List)


Implements a password‑protected passenger database for Rail Ireland using a **singly linked list**. Supports add/display/search/update/delete, file save/restore, statistics by area **within selected travel class**, report generation, and ordering by year born. Password input is masked with `*` and credentials are loaded from `data/login.txt` (exact 6‑char passwords).
